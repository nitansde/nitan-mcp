## Next Steps to Publish

1. **Create npm account** (if you don't have one)
   ```bash
   # Sign up at https://www.npmjs.com/signup
   npm login
   ```

2. **Verify package name availability**
   ```bash
   npm search @nitan/mcp
   # Should return no results if available
   ```

3. **Create @nitan organization** (if needed)
   ```bash
   # Go to https://www.npmjs.com/org/create
   # Create organization named "nitan"
   # Or publish as unscoped: "nitan-mcp"
   ```

4. **Test package locally**
   ```bash
   npm pack --dry-run
   # Review what will be published
   
   npm pack
   tar -tzf nitan-mcp-*.tgz
   # Verify contents include dist/http/cloudscraper_wrapper.py
   ```

5. **Publish to npm**
   ```bash
   npm publish --access public
   ```

6. **Test installation**
   ```bash
   npx -y @nitan/mcp@latest --help
   ```

7. **Update version for next release**
   ```bash
   pnpm version patch  # 0.1.9 -> 0.1.10
   ```

## Pre-Publish Checklist

- [ ] All tests passing: `pnpm test`
- [ ] Clean build successful: `pnpm run clean && pnpm run build`
- [ ] Python script in dist/: `ls dist/http/cloudscraper_wrapper.py`
- [ ] requirements.txt in dist/: `ls dist/requirements.txt`
- [ ] README.md is up to date
- [ ] Version number is correct in package.json
- [ ] Logged into npm: `npm whoami`
- [ ] Organization created (if using @nitan scope)

## Troubleshooting

### "Organization not found"
If you get an error about @nitan organization:

**Option 1**: Create the organization on npm
- Go to https://www.npmjs.com/org/create
- Create "nitan" organization (may require payment for scoped packages)

**Option 2**: Publish as unscoped package
```json
// In package.json, change:
"name": "nitan-mcp"  // instead of "@nitan/mcp"
"bin": {
  "nitan-mcp": "dist/index.js"
}
```

Then publish with:
```bash
npm publish
```

### Python Dependencies Not Installing
Users can manually install:
```bash
pip3 install cloudscraper
```

Or use a virtual environment:
```bash
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install cloudscraper
```

## Support & Issues

After publishing, direct users to:
- GitHub repository for issues
- README.md for documentation
- TOOLS.md for custom tools reference
- PUBLISHING.md for maintenance guide

## What Happens After `npm install`

1. Package downloaded from npm registry
